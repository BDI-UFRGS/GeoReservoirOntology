# Sedimentological Ontologies

The Sedimentological Ontologies are designed to support the description of depositional system properties in outcrop and seismic scales. The terminology should cover depositional bodies, as well as their geometrical and sedimentological features. By geometrical features, we mean geomorphological characters such as shapes, spatial relations, and dimensions. By sedimentary features, we mean characters such as facies and lithological classification.

The ontologies use the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO) and the [GeoCore ontology](https://github.com/BDI-UFRGS/GeoCoreOntology). BFO is specially designed for describing scientific fields, while GeoCore defines precisely a limited set of concepts in Geology that permeate the whole domain. BFO and GeoCore provide a solid foundation, which the Sedimentological Ontologies use to make themselves interoperable.

This project is in the development phase and shall be published soon. If one wants to subscribe to news, feel free to star or watch this repository.
