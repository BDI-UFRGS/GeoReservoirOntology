# GeoReservoir Ontology

GeoReservoir is an ontology to support the description of the geometry and the lithology of deep-marine deposits. The GeoReservoir ontology provides formal and clear definitions of deep-marine depositional system entities, creating an unambiguous terminology for geometrical and lithological properties of the deposits in the scale of outcrop and seismic sections. These definitions are independent of tasks, geological interpretations, and process inferences. We created this language to make it possible to formally and uniformly describe any deep-marine occurrence in the world with an adequate level of detail for sedimentological studies and computer processing.
