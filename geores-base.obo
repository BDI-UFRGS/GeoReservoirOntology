name: channel unit
def: "An elongated Depositional Unit having some Channel Surface as its boundary and constituted by some Sediment or Sedimentary Rock that fills it (McHargue et al., 2011)." []
comment: In stratigraphic terms, a channel unit is constituted by the sediments or sedimentary rocks that fill a channel. It is important to notice that, in more general terms, a channel is a passageway for fluids or sediments, i.e., an immaterial entity. If one elaborates about the erosion and deposition processes that generate these units (McHargue et al., 2011), it is essential to have this disambiguation.
comment: In this work, we decided not to model the named hierarchical scales as entities (e.g., Channel Element, Channel Complex, Channel Complex Set - McHargue et al., 2011) because there exists a wide variety of hierarchical schemes in the literature, and they are not necessarily interoperable (Cullis et al., 2018). Instead, we focus on the fact that units can be fractally nested: a unit can be a Proper Spatial Part Of another unit, which can be a Proper Spatial Part Of another unit, and so forth. We consider that this approach solves the problem of implementing a solution for the repeatability of the geological objects in multiple scales. As so, a Channel Unit can be decomposed in other Channel Units many times as necessary, keeping the representation structure. In the future, we can study the integration of hierarchical schemes and try to infer scales from the spatial relations.

name: levee unit
def: "A Depositional Unit having Wedge Geometry and forming a bank or ridge geomorphology associated with some Channel Unit." []
comment: This term is not consensual as some authors refer to these units as the wedge-shape embankments around channels, which is the definition that we adopt here, while other authors refer to them as not necessarily being these embankments and possibly having wing shapes, among other definitions.
comment: This term refers to the geomorphological association of some wegde-shaped unit with some channel unit, even if the channel does not exist at the moment of the observation by the geologist and the levee is probabilistically identified by tendencies (e.g., typical facies). In other words, the term "levee" ontologicallly denotes this relation even though it cannot be deterministically observed.

def: "A pattern of properties of Geological Objects." []
comment: This entity is defined in the literature as a combination of features that differentiates a geological object from its adjacent geological objects (Walker and James, 1992). However, a Facies does not describe a single Geological Object’s features: it might repeat in several objects as a pattern. This particular aspect matches the definition of Generically Dependent Continuant in BFO. Another important aspect is that the features that compose facies vary depending on the research context, e.g., Sedimentary Facies, Petrofacies (De Ros and Goldberg, 2007), Lithofacies, Ichnofacies, and Biofacies (Nichols, 2009).
